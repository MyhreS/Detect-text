TODO
- Format the real data into the new format.
- Change the images_and_labels.py to fit the real data.
- Create an end-to-end network with the inference graph and the residual network, with the layers needed between them.
   - A object detection results layer. That extracts the results and makes them into images.
   - Reshape layer
   - Normalization layer and grayscale layer

- Fix the entire dataset to fit this network architecture.
- Create a proper residual network that can be changed while on the server.

After machine learning course:
- Create synthetic data, with data of only characters and where they are in the image.
- Create a network that detects characters instead of words. or characters from words.
